                <h2>Smart Appliances</h2>
                <p>Aim of this project is to reduce the amount of power consumed by every household and office,
                    which share major energy consumption.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nowadays, humankind is moving towards new technologies by replacing manual operations with
                    automatically controlled devices.
                    The basic requirements for the people are light's and a fan's.
                    Over time these two have become needs and they are more considered as comforts.
                    Usually, we use fans and light throughout the day depending upon the environmental factors such
                    as availability of sunlight, temperature and climate situations, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, what if we have an option to control our appliances depending on these factors without any
                    effort? sounds amazing right. With the use of IoT, we can make this possible.
                    We can convert our regular, daily using appliances to fully automated appliances, which in turn
                    reduce human efforts and also save electricity.
                    We will further see how the idea of making appliances automatic will work by using a prototype
                    model.

                <h4>Working:</h4>
                <hr>
                <p>PIR sensor is used to detect the human motion and send inputs to the microcontroller.
                    Based on the PIR sensor inputs, the microcontroller looks for the inputs from LDR and Thermistor
                    which gives input to the controller about the natural day light availability and the room
                    temperature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on these three sensor inputs, the controller will operate the LED lights and the fan. This
                    model is a prototype, so small scale sensors can do the work.
                    When we need to implement this concept on a large scale basis, we need to use advanced sensors
                    which replace the basic sensors but performs the same operation.

                  <h2>Solar Electric Vehicle</h2>
                  <p>Since the fuel prices are increasing day by day not only in India, but throughout the world,
                    there is a tremendous need to search an alternative to conserve the natural resources and save
                    the environment at the same time by reducing the pollution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus a solar vehicle is an electric vehicle that provides that alternative by harnessing solar
                    energy to charge the battery and thus provide required voltage to run the motor. Since India is
                    blessed with nine months of sunny climate, the concept of solar vehicle is very friendly in
                    India. Therefore solar vehicle can become a vital alternative to the fuel using automobiles.
                    The promising benefits of this concept are:
                </p>
                <p>➢ Using solar energy will enhance the efficiency of the vehicle.</p>
                <p>➢ Shifting towards sustainable movement by saving fossil fuels and using sunlight as a renewable
                    resource.</p>
                <p>➢ Reducing pollution in the environment, as solar vehicles do not emit toxic gases.</p>
                </p>
                <h4>Components Used:</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>➢ Two 12V Solar Panels</p>
                    <p>➢ 24volts Brushed DC Motor</p>
                    <p>➢ Two 12v, 7.5Amp Lead Acid Batteries</p>
                    <p>➢ A DC Motor Controller</p>
                    <p>➢ Arduino UNO to display voltage and current readings</p>
                    <p>➢ Accelerator, Brakes</p>
                    <p>➢ Solar Charger</p>
                    <p>➢ Connecting Wires</p>
                    <p>➢ 5 LED's</p>
                    <p>➢ Resistors(1-19 kohm, 1-5 kohm, 6-100 ohm)</p>
                    <h4>Working</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>From the above block diagram, we‘ll get a basic idea of what‘s going on. Let us divide this block
                        diagram into two parts, the below Part and the above part.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The below part tells us how the connections are made between motor and the controller, the above
                        part explains us additionally how solar panels are arranged and used along with the main system.
                        In this entire arrangement, the motor controller is the heart of the system. It is used to
                        control the motor by taking the input from the accelerator and brakes.
                        The accelerator is used to control the speed of the motor and brakes are used to cut the power
                        supply to the motor so that there will be no supply to the wheels to rotate.
                        The motor controller is also used to power the headlamps, brake lights. It also comes with an
                        inbuilt charging port which allows us to charge the batteries using an adaptor.
                        The working of this model is as simple as this: The motor controller takes the input from the
                        accelerator and controls the rotation of the motor similarly it takes input from brakes to cut
                        off the rotation of the motor.
                        But without an external energy source, it is not possible to use the motor. So we have to
                        connect the batteries to the power port on the motor controller to supply adequate power to
                        drive the motor.
                        There are some other minor components such as headlamps, charge indicators which are used to our
                        comfort.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To this system, we additionally need to connect the solar panels to make this an efficient model
                        to use.
                        After arranging the panels, we have to connect the two 12v solar panels in series making in 24v.
                        These wires from solar panels are connected to the charge controller. The use of a charge
                        controller is to avoid any fluctuations and to avoid overcharging of the batteries.
                        To charge the batteries with solar energy we have to connect the battery terminals at their
                        respective terminals on the charge controller.
                        Since we have 2 options to charge the bike now, out of which one is a continuous source, we have
                        succeeded in making an efficient and low-cost electric vehicle to use.

                    <h4>Working:</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>The working of remote-controlled robot goes like this: </p>
                    <p>We give the commands forward, backward, left, and right from the transmitter (in our case it is
                        our mobile), now these commands are received by the receiver that is our HC-05 bluetooth module
                        which is connected to the Arduino board. Arduino will receive these signals from bluetooth
                        module with the help of TX and RX pins.</p>
                    <p>The Arduino board then sends the signal to the L293 motor driver, which is responsible for
                        guiding and controlling all the motors that are used to move the robot.</p>
                    <p>To make Arduino board a responsible board we need to program the microcontroller.
                        Here we use the Arduino IDE platform to write, check, compile, and to upload the code to
                        Arduino.

                <h2>Smart Street Lights</h2>
                <p>This Project aims for designing and executing the advanced development of street lights to save
                    energy.
                    We are all aware that the street lights are switched on manually after it gets dark in the night
                    and are switched off the next day when there’s sufficient light.</p>
                <p>
                    But There’s a high possibility and there are real-time instances where they’re not switched on
                    at the correct time causing troublesome experiences to drivers who travel at night and also
                    sometimes are not switched off even when there is natural light available, leading to sheer
                    wastage of energy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, this proposed project helps to overcome these difficulties and help us to save energy by
                    making the process automatic, where street lights will turn on under neccessary conditions based
                    on pedestrians and vehicles movement.
                    I'm going to discuss the creation of its prototype, which can be implemented in real time
                    application.
                </p>

                    <p>➢ 9v External Power Supply (If needed)</p>
                    <h4>Working:</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Once the Connections are set-up, and after uploading the code, if we run it, we can clearly
                        observe that initially the lights are switched off, if any vehicle enters in its (sensor)
                        proximity, the LEDs glow and provide the light.
                        This Proximity can be set accordingly to our requirements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The work of the photo-resistor or LDR is that, if there is sufficient light falling on it, it
                        doesn’t let the LEDs glow unnecessarily, and makes them glow only when there’s no sufficient
                        light falling on it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hence this system can be applied in real time so that we can reduce the wastage of electricity
                        and also reduce the manual work force to operate them.

                <h2>MBX Sales Application</h2>
                <p>The purpose of this project is to build a search engine for sales executives who can search thier
                    prospective accounts and contacts from the salesforce application.
                    The search engine is implemented using Salesforce Administration, Apex programming language,
                    Lightning Web Components, Salesforce Object Query Language.
                    Along with the development of search engine, other features like pagination, navigation, report
                    dashboard were also implemented for ease accessability which will improve the executives
                    productivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To implement the above mentioned functionalities, I used salesforce administration tools like
                    data import, object manager, lookup and master relationships, etc to set up data and the
                    required conditions.
                    Finally to make sure the work is done with quality, I used test classes and debugging concept to
                    test the code coverage and the potential errors.
                </p>

                <p>➢Creation of custom objects and fields using object manager </p>
                <p>➢Using lookup and master relationships to create parent child relationships</p>
                <p>➢Creating profiles and using permission sets to maintain data integrity. This will not allow the
                    users to access
                    other sales executive records.
                </p>
                <p>➢ Apex programming to implement the search functionality by taking input and retrieving data from
                    database and to test the created apex classes to ensure code coverage</p>
                <p>➢ SOQL to query data from the database</p>
                <p>➢ Lighning web components to design the UI</p>
                <p>➢ Java Script to implement pagination to display 5 records per page</p>
                <p>➢ Java Script to implement navigation to the selected record</p>
                <p>➢ Reports and dashboards to implement data visualization</p>
                <h4>Working:</h4>
                <hr>
                <p>As a sales executive when I logged in to the application, I want to search my potential customers
                    instead of going through every record.
                    Search engine will help me in searching the required customers by allowing me to enter their
                    name in the search box.
                    From the matching output list I can directly navigate to the customer record page to deal with
                    sales activity.
                    To make it even simple, only 5 records per page are displayed, this will allow me to look in to
                    the records clearly without missing any.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apart from accessing customers, I can also look in to the statistics and data with the help of
                    data visualization, where data is showcased in the form of pie charts, bar graphs instead of
                    large and boring paragraphs.
